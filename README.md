# Lottie MK I - your best friend!


Using the combined powers of Natural Language Processing, Intent Classification, and the Carter API, Lottie is here to help you and make your life easier!

It is an open source Artificial Intelligence program, which can be configured and customised according to your needs.

# What can Lottie do?

Lottie has several built-in functions besides its Artificial Intelligence, and is an ultimate combination of all my previous projects.

- Built-in Tuyapy Device Controller
- PC Control
- She has a discord, voice, GUI and a chrome extension interface
- She can wake you up at a certain time
- Search the web
- Show you the news, weather, sports...
- Open source, finally!

# What makes Lottie different to all other open source AIs?

Lottie's natural language generation is provided by Carter, which delivers fast and powerfully intelligent responses to its users. 
Her natural language processing uses the powerful combination of NLTK and PyTorch libraries.
Apart from that, absolutely nothing, I just wanted to make a version of my personal Lily framework that everyone can use.
